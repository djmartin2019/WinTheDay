# WinTheDay

Wake up and smell the code! Ditching React and Node to master the basics with 'WinTheDay.' Complete tasks, earn faux-currency, and buy free time. No frameworks, just pure HTML, CSS, and JS. Because sometimes, you've gotta go old school to understand the new school.

## Features

### Additional Features
